            <ul>
                <li> <span> carrion;</span> </li>
                <li><span>blood;</span></li>

                <li><span>animals slaughtered not the name of God, the downtrodden in the name of some deity or saint (idolatry);</span></li>
                <li><span>animals killed by strangulation or other animals; died as a result of high voltage, shock or falling;</span></li>
                <li><span>predatory animals (wolf, lion, tiger, etc.) and birds of prey (falcon, hawk, eagle and others.);</span></li>
                <li><span>meat dogs, donkeys and mules;</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>All these prohibitions apply not only to the main raw material (meat and fat), but also apply to raw materials and auxiliary materials, such as additives, fillers, spices, natural sausage casings, gelatin thickeners and more.</p>
            <p>Sometimes production meets experts "all ready" - manufacturer of pre-figuring out what conditions are necessary for compliance with the standard "Halal" and only then apply for certification. There are also opposite cases where the manufacturer's confidence in its ability to qualify for a certificate is based on commonplaces stereotypes about Muslims and their food standards. For example, some believe that the certification of "Halal" - it's just a Muslim blessing come imam who gives a blessing, and any special conditions of production is not necessary. Others believe that eliminating ingredients such as pork and alcohol, they are already producing "halal" products, and requires only a certificate. Someone thinks it possible to add to the "halal" meat unproven supplements, which also makes the certification invalid.</p>

                    <b>At the request of the manufacturer, they make recommendations to bring production into line with the standard "Halal"</b>, and perform a second check after the completion of all work on the implementation of these recommendations.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, it is impossible to specify a precise time frame, since it depends not only on us but also on the producer. In each case, we coordinate its work with the mode of operation of the manufacturer, production location, the possibility to organize the departure of our experts and the possibility of their products to take. In addition, a very important factor is the actual readiness of the enterprise to produce halal products at the time of the visit of experts; if it is "zero", as the reorganization of the production is time-consuming, and plant alterations - also means. </p>
                <p>Naturally, the producer is interested to provide conditions for the speedy passage of the procedure.</p>

            <h2>Monitoring compliance with <br> standard "Halal"</h2>
            <p> There are several options for the implementation of product quality control and compliance with its standard of "Halal». </p>
            <p> <b> We insist on the constant presence of our experts at meat and poultry </b>, it is in these areas of the industry is extremely important to comply with all terms and subtleties of face. </p>
            <p> Manufacturers of non-implementation of the direct slaughter of livestock and poultry, prefer on-site inspections of our experts, who naturally carried out without prior notice. In case of refusal to admit expert (with the necessary package of documents, including sanitary books) certificate shall be canceled for the production. </p>

            </div>
            
            <p>Some products are multiple certification at all production stages. For example, a meat producer is certified for compliance with the standard of its products "Halal". They have a supply contract with the manufacturer of sausage, which is also undergoing certification of its products to meet the standard of "Halal", because at the stage of processing meat into finished products or semi-finished product may come into contact ingredients annihilating halal meat. In addition, products made from meat slaughtered according to Shariah animal if such meat as a result of violation of the conditions or terms of storage spoiled, will not be halal.</p>
            <p>Thus, the certification takes place at different stages of production, which certainly is an additional guarantee for the consumer.</p>
            <p>Apart from that, the certificate has a validity period - 1 year, after which the certification procedure is repeated.</p>
            <p>Fatwa Committee at DUMA "Ummah" with the Centre for Research and Certification Halal "Alraid" pays special attention to monitoring and issuing certification businesses worrying about the safety of their products, and according to it with all necessary regulations and standards. </p>
